                <p class="about__text">
                    Hi! My name is Michelle Andersson. I'm an American-Swede with a passion for creating beautiful and well-functioning websites. 
                    I'm a nature enthusiast with a love for photography and cats. I'm always on the lookout for the next adventure and will jump 
                    at any opportunity to grow and learn something new. My passion for web development started as a curiosity for how websites work,
                    which lead to a couple of months spending every free minute I had learning HTML and CSS through Khan Academy. 
                    To my great pleasure I was accepted into Pink Programming's intensive course for front end development. I now spend 
                    every day working on improving my programming skills and diving deep into the fascinating world of web programming and design.

                                This project consisted of creating what would look like a Spotify music player. I was told to open the 
                                Spotify music player on my laptop and to recreate the layout from scratch without any design guidelines.
                                This was my first attempt at creating something from scratch without having the guidelines from Figma 
                                to help along the way. This project was a great learning experience because it forced me to really think 
                                about how the music player was laid out. I was not given the layout answers straight away as with most other
                                designs through Figma, but required me to be creative in how to approach the construction of the site. Not that 
                                the site does not actually play music since this was an exercise in design layout, not audio. However, if I were 
                                to remake this project, I would definitely work on adding audio to it. Note that this is only developed for desktop.

                                This project focused on making a functioning website that incorporated most of the basics of website development. The 
                                website was created from scratch based on a design in Figma. It was to be fully responsive, have several images
                                and sections with content, and be completed within a narrow timelimit. This was one of the more complex designs I 
                                have (at the time) created and am happy with how the result turned out. This project pushed me to think quickly and 
                                creatively on how to solve the problem at hand: how do I create this large landing page as complete as possible within
                                my timelimit? This was a good challange in finding a balance between getting the page to look good and having the 
                                page be complete with all sections, information, and functionality.

                                and implemented the necessary flexible code and media queries to make the website look good not only on
                                the three different device screen sizes, but on all sizes inbetween as well.

                                This project focused on creating a site that looked realistic based on a layout from Figma. The site was to include
                                features such as a form, buttons, links, and be responsive. Since this site was to look realistic, it was good practice
                                for design and layout. It incorporated several different types of elements which had to work together to look good on 
                                all screen sizes which was a fun challenge.
